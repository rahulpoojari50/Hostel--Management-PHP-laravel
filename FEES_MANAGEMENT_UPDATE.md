# Fees Management Update

## Overview
This update implements the requested functionality for the student portal fees management system. When a student clicks "Pay Now" on pending fees, they are redirected to the application page where they can see all fees (both paid and pending) and pay for pending fees directly from the application form. The room type is pre-selected and disabled when coming from the fees page. **Duplicate fees have been cleaned up and prevented.**

## Key Changes

### 1. Updated FeesController (`app/Http/Controllers/Student/FeesController.php`)
- **Modified `pending()` method**: Now shows all fees (both paid and pending) in a single view with duplicate handling
- **Modified `pay()` method**: Redirects to the application page with `from_fees` parameter
- **Added RoomApplication import**: For finding the student's latest application
- **Duplicate fee handling**: Groups fees by type and shows latest status

### 2. Updated ApplicationController (`app/Http/Controllers/Student/ApplicationController.php`)
- **Modified `create()` method**: Now handles existing fees and shows their status with duplicate prevention
- **Added room type locking**: Disables room type selection when coming from fees page
- **Modified `store()` method**: Handles both new applications and updates to existing applications
- **Added fee status tracking**: Shows paid/pending status for each fee type
- **Enhanced fee processing**: Updates existing fees or creates new ones based on status
- **Session management**: Clears `from_fees` session after processing
- **Duplicate prevention**: Checks for existing fees before creating new ones

### 3. Updated Application Form (`resources/views/student/applications/create.blade.php`)
- **Complete redesign**: Shows all fees with their current status
- **Status indicators**: Clear badges for paid/pending status
- **Interactive checkboxes**: 
  - Paid fees are disabled and show "Paid" badge

- **Visual feedback**: Clear distinction between paid and pending fees
- **Room type locking**: Disabled and pre-selected when coming from fees page

### 4. Updated Navigation (`resources/views/layouts/admin.blade.php`)
- **Simplified structure**: Changed from submenu to single "Fees Management" link
- **Direct access**: Points directly to the new comprehensive fees view

### 5. Database Cleanup Migration (`database/migrations/2025_07_28_115209_cleanup_duplicate_fees.php`)
- **Duplicate fee cleanup**: Removes duplicate fee records
- **Status preservation**: Keeps paid status when cleaning duplicates

## Technical Details

### Database Structure
- Uses existing `student_fees` table
- `status` field: 'pending' or 'paid'
- `paid_at` timestamp for paid fees
- `fee_type` field for different fee categories
- **No duplicate records**: Each student-hostel-fee_type combination has only one record

### Fee Types Supported
- `room_rent`: Room rental fee
- `admission_fee`: Admission fee
- `seat_rent`: Seat rental fee
- `medical_aid_fee`: Medical aid fee
- `mess_fee`: Mess fee
- `Security Fee`: Security deposit

### Session Management
- `from_fees` session: Indicates user came from fees page
- Session cleared after processing to prevent future conflicts
- Proper validation based on session state

### Duplicate Prevention Logic
- **Grouping**: Fees are grouped by student, hostel, and fee type
- **Status priority**: If any fee of a type is paid, the entire type is considered paid
- **Latest record**: Uses the most recent fee record for each type
- **Cleanup migration**: Removes existing duplicates from database

### Routes
- `GET /student/fees/pending` - Main fees management page
- `POST /student/fees/pay/{id}` - Pay a specific fee (redirects to application)
- `GET /student/hostels/{hostel}/apply` - Application form with fee status
- `POST /student/hostels/{hostel}/apply` - Submit application with fee payments

### Security
- All routes protected by student middleware
- Students can only access their own fees and applications
- Proper validation and authorization checks
- Session-based room type locking prevents unauthorized changes

## Testing

The implementation can be tested by:
1. Logging in as a student with an existing application (e.g., "nagaraj" with Single room type)
2. Navigating to "Fees Management"
3. Verifying no duplicate fees are shown
4. Clicking "Pay Now" on a pending fee
5. Verifying redirect to application page
6. Checking that the application form shows:
   - Room type pre-selected and disabled (e.g., "Single")
   - Informational message about room type being locked
   - Button text changed to "Pay Pending Fees"
   - Paid fees with disabled checkboxes and "Paid" badges
   - Pending fees with enabled checkboxes and "Pending" badges
   - Correct total calculation based on selected fees
